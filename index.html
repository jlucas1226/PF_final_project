    <h2>Sabotage in the Senate!</h2>
    <p>
      It is the 1st century B.C., and a pivotal time for Rome. After a young adulthood full of persecution and hardship, Gaius Julius Caesar erupted into the stratosphere of Roman politics, acting as a cunning statesman and
      brilliant general. Caesar was a true military genius, winning battles throughout all of Europe, from Britannia in the distant north, to North Africa, to Pontus (modern day Turkey), Greece, and Eygpt. After a period of 
      civil war, his greatest rival, Pompey Magnus, lay dead in Eygpt, and the Roman world was his to command. Caesar was appointed dictator for life by the Roman Senate. He lead the Populares faction in Roman politics, a sort
      of proto-populist party, and passed many laws beneficial to his constiuents, such as massive debt forgiveness amongst to poorer classes. Understandably, this led to his overwhelming popularity among the plebs, or commoners
      of Rome. He even oversaw the creation of the Julian calendar, which saw use far after the fall of the Roman Empire itself, deep into the middle ages. As a military general, he was so ingenius and all conquering that his 
      name, Caesar, has been taken as a leadership title in multiple countries, such as Kaiser in Germany and Czar in Russia. But with his meteoric success came danger and conspiracy from his political enemies.

    <h3>Conspiracy and Assassination</h3>
    <p>
      Since the end of the Roman monarchy in 509 B.C., the Roman populace hated kings, tyrants, and the idea of monarchy. They overthrew their 7th and final king in that year and became the world's first republic. However, 
      after years of strife, war, and hardship, the Senate found itself appointing two separate individuals to the position of dictator for life consecutively. After appointing Sulla, who reigned as dictator throughout Caesar's
      youth (and even senteced him to death, though Caesar avoided capture and execution until he was pardoned), the increasingly worried Senate appointed Caesar to a lifelong dictatorship following his victory in the recent
      civil war. The Senatorial class started to fear that a monarchy was reestablishing itself, slowly but surely in Rome. As such, a conspiracy of about 70 senators took it upon themselves to prevent this by assassinating 
      Caesar on the Ides of March in 44 B.C.. Ironically, by doing this, they ensured the decline of the Senate as an institution, as Caesar's adopted son Octavian would go on to succeed his father and become Augustus, the 
      first true Emperor of Rome. Strangely enough, as the rumors of this plot quietly spread, many of Caesar's supporters caught wind of them and tried to warn their leader, but ultimately failed. The narrow success of the 
      assassination plot inspired me to make my project into a game where this may have been avoided. Should Caesar have survived the assassination, he likely would've gone on to conquer in the east, as he was set to leave
      on a campaign against Parthia, an empire encompassing much of the modern Middle-East and Rome's greatest rival, and if his prior record was any indication, it is likely he would've expanded his empire even further.
