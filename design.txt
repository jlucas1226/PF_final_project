PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  A program is needed that functions as a text game for a user. In this case, the game will be a text-based mystery game set in ancient Rome. The game will prompt the user with the mystery scenario, that they are trying to 
  find the traitorous senator and accuse them, thus saving their leader, Julius Caesar, from assassination. Next, the game will prompt the user, using a WHILE loop, for which of three senators, Longinus, Cicero, or Atticus, 
  they want to speak with. The player will be able to 'press' the three suspects for more information. Finally, when the user has figured they have enough confidence to accuse a senator, they may type 'accuse' and name the 
  suspect. The game will use a nested IF statement to determine the user input. If the user accuses the quilty senator, they win, while they lose if they accuse the incorrect senator. They player may type 'quit' if they wish to 
  exit the game. User inputs and processing will be separated into separate functions.
